## Find the link (Easy - Reversing)

### Description

Oh my God. This is driving me crazy.

I think that there's a way to discover the algorithm behind the link check... but HOW?

### Compile

```bash
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

### Execute
```bash
chmod +x dist/FindTheLink
cd dist
./FindTheLink
```

#### Hints

1. How does the program check the validity of the input?

2. Focus on this function
```c
int check_password(char* password)
```

3. Hint is: `??????/????????????in?ha??ati`
